.SH NAME
    hsh - interface to the Unix system

.SH SYNOPSIS
    $ [command] [-flag ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
     A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix  system. 
     It gathers input from you and  executes  programs  based on 
     that input. When a program  finishes executing, it displays
     that program's output.
     
.SH SHOPTIONS
     cd [arg]
     Change  the  current directory  to arg. The shell parameter
     $HOME is the default arg. If no  directory arg is found and
     the  $CDPATH   parameter  contains  a  list  of directories
     separated by colons, each of these directories is used as a
     prefix to arg in the given order, and the current directory
     is set to the first one that is found.
        $ cd /usf/lb

     env 
     Prints the current environment

     exit 
     Causes the shell to exit with the exit status  specified by 
     n. If n is omitted then the exit status is that of the last 
     command executed. (An end of file will  also exit  from the 
     shell.)

     pwd
     Prints the name of the current directory.
